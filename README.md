## Introduction

This diary is intended to keep track of my learning progress, projects, and reflections as I work through the MERN stack. By maintaining this diary, I aim to reinforce my understanding, identify areas for improvement, and share my journey with others.

## Goals

1. Gain a solid understanding of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
2. Build and deploy at least three full-stack projects using the MERN stack.
3. Document daily progress, challenges, and solutions.
4. Improve problem-solving skills and coding best practices.
