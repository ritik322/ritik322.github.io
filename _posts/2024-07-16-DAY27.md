## React Hooks

**Description:**  
React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks simplify state management and lifecycle methods, allowing developers to build complex components without relying on class-based components.

### Key Points to Cover:

1. **What are Hooks?**
   - Hooks are JavaScript functions that enable you to “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from functional components. They help manage state and side effects, promoting cleaner and more modular code.

2. **The `useState` Hook:**
   - The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components. You call it at the top level of your component to create a state variable and a function to update it.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   function Counter() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
           <div>
               <h1>{count}</h1>
               <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
           </div>
       );
   }
   ```
2. **The `useEffect` Hook:**
   - The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations. It runs after every render by default but can be controlled by providing a dependency array.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    function DataFetcher() {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
            fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(data => setData(data));
        }, []); // Empty array means this effect runs once on mount

        return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;
    }

   ```   
3. **The `useContext` Hook:**
   - The `useContext` hook allows you to access context values directly without the need for the Context.Consumer wrapper. It simplifies consuming context in functional components.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    function DataFetcher() {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
            fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(data => setData(data));
        }, []); // Empty array means this effect runs once on mount

        return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;
    }

   ```     
4. **Conclusion:**
   - React Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to manage state and side effects in functional components. They promote cleaner code and enable developers to create reusable logic, leading to more maintainable and scalable applications.
