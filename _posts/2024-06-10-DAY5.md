## Topics Covered

### If Statement

Learned how to use the if statement to execute code based on a condition.
Example: Checking if a number is greater than 2.

### If-Else Statement

Explored how to use the if-else statement to provide an alternative action when the condition is not met.
Example: Comparing numbers and determining which one is larger.

### If-Elif-Else Statement

Studied the if-elif-else statement for multiple conditions.
Example: Checking multiple conditions to determine if one number is greater than, less than, or equal to another.

### Practice Questions

Worked on various practice problems to apply conditional statements in different scenarios.
Examples include checking age for adulthood, temperature for freezing, scores for grades, and more.

### Challenges Faced

Understanding the correct syntax and structure for nested conditions.
Ensuring the logical flow of multiple conditions in if-elif-else statements.

### Successes

Successfully implemented multiple conditional statements in practice problems.
Gained a clear understanding of how conditional statements control the flow of a program.

## Next Steps

- Continue practicing conditional statements with more complex scenarios.
- Start learning about loops and how they can be combined with conditional statements for more powerful programming constructs.
