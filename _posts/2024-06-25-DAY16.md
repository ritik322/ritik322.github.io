## Summary
Today, I focused on basic image preprocessing steps using OpenCV in Python, including converting an image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, and detecting edges with the Canny edge detector.

## Detailed Steps
1. **Read the Image:** I started by importing the necessary libraries and reading the image from a file.
2. **Convert the Image to Grayscale:** The image was then converted from BGR color space to grayscale.
3. **Apply Gaussian Blur:** I applied Gaussian blur to the grayscale image to reduce noise and detail.
4. **Detect Edges using the Canny Edge Detector:** Edges were detected in the blurred image using the Canny edge detector.
5. **Display the Results:** Finally, the original image, grayscale image, and edge-detected image were displayed using matplotlib.

## Results
The original image was successfully converted to grayscale, smoothed using Gaussian blur, and edges were detected using the Canny edge detector. The results were displayed using matplotlib.

## Conclusion
Today's work on image preprocessing and edge detection using OpenCV-Python was successful. This exercise provided a clear understanding of basic image processing techniques essential for more complex computer vision tasks.

## Future Steps
Next, I plan to explore object detection using Haar Cascades in OpenCV.
