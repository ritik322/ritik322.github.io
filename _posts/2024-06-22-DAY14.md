### Daily Diary for Matplotlib Assignment

#### **Matplotlib Assignment Progress**

Today, I focused on completing a series of data visualization tasks for my Matplotlib assignment.

1. **Total Profit Line Plot**
    - I created a line plot to visualize the total profit for each month. The plot clearly showed the monthly trends, which was the main objective.

2. **Styled Total Profit Line Plot**
    - I enhanced the initial total profit line plot with additional styling. This included adding dotted red lines with circle markers, making the data points more prominent and visually appealing. I also added a legend to improve the clarity of the plot.

3. **Multiline Plot for Product Sales**
    - I generated a multiline plot to display the monthly sales data for each product. This plot helped to compare the sales performance of different products over the months.

4. **Toothpaste Sales Scatter Plot**
    - To get a more detailed view of the toothpaste sales, I created a scatter plot. This visualization highlighted the variability in sales month-to-month more clearly than a line plot.

5. **Face Cream and Facewash Bar Chart**
    - I compared the sales of face cream and facewash by using a bar chart. This chart provided a straightforward comparison of the two products' sales figures on a monthly basis.

6. **Bathing Soap Sales Bar Chart**
    - Another bar chart was created to display the sales data of bathing soap. This helped to isolate and analyze the sales trend for this specific product.

7. **Profit Histogram**
    - I used a histogram to visualize the frequency distribution of the total profits. This allowed me to identify the most common profit ranges throughout the year.

8. **Total Sales Pie Chart**
    - A pie chart was created to show the total sales distribution for each product over the last year. This provided a clear overview of the contribution of each product to the total sales.

9. **Bathing Soap and Facewash Subplots**
    - I displayed the sales data for bathing soap and facewash side by side using subplots. This side-by-side comparison made it easier to see the sales trends for these two products simultaneously.

10. **Stack Plot for All Products**
    - Lastly, I created a stack plot to show the combined sales data of all products over the months. This plot provided a comprehensive view of how each product contributed to the total sales volume each month.

Overall, today was productive, and I was able to complete several key visualizations for my assignment. Each plot served a specific purpose and provided insights into the sales data from different perspectives.
