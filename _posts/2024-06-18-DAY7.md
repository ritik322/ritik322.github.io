# Operators in JavaScript

Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic calculations on numeric values.

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let sum = x + y; // Addition
let difference = x - y; // Subtraction
let product = x * y; // Multiplication
let quotient = x / y; // Division
let remainder = x % y; // Modulus
let exponentiation = x ** y; // Exponentiation
````

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

````javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

a += b; // Equivalent to: a = a + b;
a -= b; // Equivalent to: a = a - b;
a *= b; // Equivalent to: a = a * b;
a /= b; // Equivalent to: a = a / b;
a %= b; // Equivalent to: a = a % b;
````
## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

````javascript
let p = 10;
let q = 5;

let isEqual = p == q; // Equal to
let isNotEqual = p != q; // Not equal to
let isGreaterThan = p > q; // Greater than
let isLessThan = p < q; // Less than
let isGreaterOrEqual = p >= q; // Greater than or equal to
let isLessOrEqual = p <= q; // Less than or equal to
````
## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

````javascript
let sunny = true;
let warm = false;

let isGoodWeather = sunny && warm; // Logical AND
let isEitherWeather = sunny || warm; // Logical OR
let isNotSunny = !sunny; // Logical NOT
````

## Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand.

````javascript
let num = 10;

num++; // Increment by 1 (post-increment)
num--; // Decrement by 1 (post-decrement)
++num; // Increment by 1 (pre-increment)
--num; // Decrement by 1 (pre-decrement)
````
## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if...else statement.

````javascript
let age = 18;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(message); // Output: Adult
````
