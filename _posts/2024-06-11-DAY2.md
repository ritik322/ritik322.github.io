### Learnings
- **HTML Tables**: Tables are created using the `<table>` tag. Each row is defined with `<tr>`, and headers and data cells are defined with `<th>` and `<td>`, respectively.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data 1</td>
      <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

- **HTML Forms**:  Forms start with the `<form>` tag, and include various input controls like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.

  <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
