# Advanced Promises and Event Loop

## Advanced Promises

### Promise.all

`Promise.all` is used to handle multiple promises concurrently. It takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved or rejects if any of the promises reject.

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(values => {
  console.log(values); // [3, 42, 'foo']
});
````

### Promise.race

`Promise.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array resolves or rejects.

````javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(value => {
  console.log(value); // 'two'
});
````

### Promise.allSettled

`Promise.allSettled` waits for all promises to settle (either resolve or reject) and returns an array of objects representing the outcome of each promise.

````javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 100, 'foo'));
const promise3 = 42;

Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(results => {
  results.forEach((result) => console.log(result.status));
});
// Output: "fulfilled" "rejected" "fulfilled"
````

### Promise.any

`Promise.any` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves as soon as any of the promises in the array resolves. If none of the promises resolve, it rejects with an AggregateError.

````javascript
const promise1 = Promise.reject(0);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'quick'));
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'slow'));

Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // 'quick'
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
````

## Event Loop

The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows for asynchronous operations. It is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

## Call Stack

The call stack is a data structure that records the place in the program that we are currently executing. When a function is called, it’s added to the call stack, and when the function returns, it’s removed from the call stack.

## Web APIs

Web APIs are browser-provided APIs that handle tasks like setTimeout, DOM manipulation, and HTTP requests. When an asynchronous operation is called, it’s sent to the Web APIs.

## Callback queue

Once the Web APIs complete their tasks, they push the callback functions to the callback queue (or task queue).

## Event Loop Process

- Call Stack Execution: The JavaScript engine first executes the code in the call stack.

- Web APIs Handling: Asynchronous functions are offloaded to Web APIs.

- Callback Queue: Once Web APIs complete their tasks, their callbacks are pushed to the callback queue.

- Event Loop: The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty, it pushes the first task from the callback queue to the call stack for execution.

### Example

````javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise callback');
});

console.log('End');
````

## Conclusion

Understanding advanced promises and the event loop is crucial for writing efficient and non-blocking asynchronous code in JavaScript. These concepts form the backbone of handling complex asynchronous operations in modern web development.
