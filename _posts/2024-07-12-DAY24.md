## State and Props

**Description:**  
State and props are two core concepts in React that enable developers to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces. Understanding how to manage state and pass props is essential for building responsive applications.

### Key Points to Cover:

1. **What are Props?**
   - **Props** (short for properties) are used to pass data and event handlers from a parent component to child components. They are immutable, meaning that a child component cannot modify the props it receives.
   - Example of using props:
     ```javascript
     function Greeting(props) {
         return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
     }

     function App() {
         return <Greeting name="Ritik" />;
     }
     ```

2. **Default Props:**
   - You can set default values for props in case they are not provided by the parent component.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     Greeting.defaultProps = {
         name: 'Guest',
     };
     ```

3. **Prop Types:**
   - To enforce the type of props a component should receive, you can use `PropTypes`. This helps in validating props and improving code quality.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

     Greeting.propTypes = {
         name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
     };
     ```

4. **What is State?**
   - **State** is a built-in object that stores data specific to a component. Unlike props, a component's state can change over time, typically in response to user actions or API calls.
   - Example of using state in a class component:
     ```javascript
     class Counter extends React.Component {
         constructor(props) {
             super(props);
             this.state = { count: 0 };
         }

         increment = () => {
             this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
         };

         render() {
             return (
                 <div>
                     <h1>{this.state.count}</h1>
                     <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
                 </div>
             );
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Using State in Functional Components:**
   - With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, you can use the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     import React, { useState } from 'react';

     function Counter() {
         const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

         return (
             <div>
                 <h1>{count}</h1>
                 <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

6. **State vs. Props:**
   - **Props**: 
     - Passed from parent to child components.
     - Immutable in child components.
     - Used for passing data and event handlers.
   - **State**:
     - Managed within the component.
     - Mutable and can change over time.
     - Used for storing dynamic data that affects rendering.

7. **Lifting State Up:**
   - When multiple components need to share the same state, you can lift the state up to the closest common ancestor. This ensures a single source of truth for the shared data.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function ParentComponent() {
         const [value, setValue] = useState("");

         return (
             <div>
                 <ChildA value={value} />
                 <ChildB setValue={setValue} />
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Mastering state and props is essential for creating dynamic and responsive React applications. Understanding their differences and how to use them effectively allows developers to build maintainable and scalable user interfaces.
