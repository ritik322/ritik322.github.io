MERN Stack stands for 4 different entities that are usefull for Web Devlopment. That are -:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that uses a flexible, JSON-like document structure, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data. 

Express.js: It simplifies the process of building server-side logic and APIs, handling various HTTP requests, and managing middleware.


React: React allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage state efficiently, and render changes quickly, leading to highly responsive user experiences.

Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side. 

# We started by HTML tags. 

  `<html>`: This tag is the root element of an HTML document. It wraps all the content on the entire page and contains the <head> and <body> elements.

 `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title and links to stylesheets and scripts. It is placed inside the <html> tag.

`<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document, which is displayed on the browser tab. It is placed inside the <head> tag.

 `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, links, and other media. It is placed inside the <html> tag, following the <head> tag.

 `<h1> to <h6>`: Define HTML headings, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` being the lowest level.

`<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.

`<img>`: Embeds an image in the HTML document. It uses the src attribute to specify the path to the image.

`<div>`: Defines a division or section in an HTML document. It is used as a container for other HTML elements to style them with CSS or to manipulate them with JavaScript.

`<span>`: Inline container for text and other inline elements. It is used to group inline-elements to apply styles or manipulate them with JavaScript.

# Summary
Today was the first day for the training. I did learn about Web Dev Tools provided by the browser that may be helpful in future. I learn exactly what is MERN Stack
And also the basics of HTML.
