### Math Module in Python

Today, we delved into the Math module in Python, exploring its vast array of functions designed to handle mathematical operations. We covered the following:

- Basic mathematical functions such as ceil, floor, and fabs.
- Trigonometric functions like sin, cos, and tan.
- Logarithmic functions including log and log10.
- Constants like pi and e.

### DateTime Module in Python

The DateTime module was another key topic today. This module is essential for handling dates and times in Python. We covered:

- Creating date and time objects using datetime, date, and time.
- Formatting dates and times with strftime and parsing with strptime.
- Calculating differences between dates using timedelta.
- Understanding time zones and converting between them.

### Numpy in Python

We also started with Numpy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Key areas covered included:

- Understanding arrays and the differences between Numpy arrays and Python lists.
- Creating arrays with functions like array, zeros, ones, and arange.
- Basic operations on Numpy arrays, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Exploring array indexing and slicing.

### 25 Questions on Math Module

To reinforce our understanding of the Math module, we tackled 25 questions. These questions ranged from simple function calls to more complex mathematical problems requiring multiple steps.

### 25 Questions on DateTime Module

Similarly, we answered 25 questions on the DateTime module. These questions tested our ability to manipulate dates and times, format and parse date strings, and perform date arithmetic.

### Practice Questions on Numpy Module

Finally, we worked on practice questions for the Numpy module. These questions helped us solidify our grasp on array creation, manipulation, and operations, preparing us for more advanced topics in the future.

## Reflections

Todayâ€™s sessions were intensive but incredibly rewarding. The Math and DateTime modules are crucial for many practical applications in Python, and Numpy is foundational for any data science or machine learning tasks. The practice questions were challenging but provided a good measure of our understanding and areas needing improvement. Looking forward to applying these concepts in upcoming projects!
