## JSX and Components

**Description:**  
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files. This feature is integral to React, as it enables the creation of components that are easy to read and maintain.

### Key Points to Cover:

1. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX is a syntax that combines JavaScript and HTML, allowing developers to write UI components in a familiar format. It resembles HTML but is transformed into JavaScript function calls by the React compiler.

2. **Why Use JSX?**
   - **Declarative Syntax**: JSX makes it easier to describe the UI structure. It looks similar to HTML, which many developers are already familiar with.
   - **Embedding Expressions**: You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX by using curly braces `{}`.
     ```javascript
     const name = "Ritik";
     const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
     ```

3. **JSX Syntax Rules:**
   - JSX must have one parent element. If multiple elements are returned, they must be wrapped in a single parent element.
     ```javascript
     const element = (
         <div>
             <h1>Hello</h1>
             <p>This is a JSX example.</p>
         </div>
     );
     ```
   - **Self-Closing Tags**: JSX allows self-closing tags for elements like `<img />`, `<input />`, and `<br />`.
   - **Class vs. className**: In JSX, `class` is replaced with `className` to avoid conflicts with the JavaScript `class` keyword.
     ```javascript
     const element = <div className="container">Content</div>;
     ```

4. **Creating Components:**
   - Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be created as either functional components or class components.
   - **Functional Components**: Simple functions that return JSX.
     ```javascript
     function Welcome(props) {
         return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
     }
     ```
   - **Class Components**: ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and include a `render` method.
     ```javascript
     class Welcome extends React.Component {
         render() {
             return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Props: Passing Data to Components:**
   - Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and should not be modified by the child component.
   - Example of passing props:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
         return <Welcome name="Ritik" />;
     }
     ```

6. **Using Components in JSX:**
   - Components can be used like HTML tags in JSX. Ensure the first letter of component names is capitalized, as React treats lowercase tags as HTML elements.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
         return (
             <div>
                 <Welcome name="Ritik" />
                 <Welcome name="Aditi" />
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

7. **Component Composition:**
   - React encourages composing components together to create complex UIs. Components can contain other components, making it easier to manage UI and logic.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
         return (
             <div>
                 <Header />
                 <Content />
                 <Footer />
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Understanding JSX and how to create components is fundamental to working with React. JSX simplifies the process of creating and managing UI, while components promote reusability and maintainability in applications.
