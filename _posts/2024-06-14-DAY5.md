### Activities

- **CSS Keyframes Animation**:
  Created a custom animation effect using keyframes for an element.

  ```css
  @keyframes slide-in {
    from {
      transform: translateX(-100%);
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(0);
    }
  }

  .animation-example {
    animation-name: slide-in;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
    animation-delay: 0s;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
    animation-direction: normal;
  }
  ```

- **CSS Transitions**: Applied transitions to elements for smooth state changes.

  ```css
  .transition-example {
    transition-property: background-color, transform;
    transition-duration: 0.3s;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  }
  ```

- **Responsive Web Design with Media Queries:**:Implemented media queries to create a responsive layout for different screen sizes.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .responsive-layout {
      flex-direction: column;
    }

    .responsive-item {
      width: 100%;
    }
  }
  ```

- **CSS Effects (Box Shadow and Gradient):**: Applied box shadow and gradient effects to enhance element styling.
  ```css
  .box-shadow-example {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
  .gradient-example {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff9966, #ff5e62);
  }
  ```


### Learnings

- **Animations**: Created animations using @keyframes and controlled them with animation properties.

- **Transitions**: Used transition-property, transition-duration, and transition-timing-function for smooth state transitions.

- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive layouts with Flexbox and media queries to adapt content across devices.
CSS Effects: Applied box shadows and gradients using respective CSS properties to add depth and visual interest.

### Notes
- CSS animations and transitions add dynamic and interactive elements to web pages, improving user experience.
- Media queries enable responsive design by adjusting layouts and styles based on viewport sizes.
- CSS effects like box shadows and gradients enhance visual appeal and design aesthetics.

### Next Steps
- Practice combining animations, transitions, responsive design principles, and CSS effects in cohesive web designs.

- Explore advanced CSS techniques such as transforms, filters, and blend modes to further enhance visual effects.

- Apply learned concepts in real-world projects to solidify understanding and proficiency in modern web design practices.
